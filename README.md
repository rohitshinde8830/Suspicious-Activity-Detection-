# Suspicious-Activity-detection-

Suspecious Activity is predicting the body part or joint locations of a
person from an image or a video. Human suspecious Activityis one 
of the key problems in computer vision that has been stud- ied for more 
than 15 years. It is important because of the sheer number of 
applications which can benefit from Activity detection. For example, 
human pose estimation is used in applications includ- ing video 
surveillance, animal tracking and behavior understand- ing, sign 
language detection, advanced human-computer interac- tion, and 
marker less motion capturing. Low cost depth sensors have limitations 
like limited to indoor use, and their low resolution and noisy depth 
information make it difficult to estimate human poses from depth 
images. Hence, we plan to use neural networks to over- come these 
problems. Suspicious human activity recognition from surveillance
video is an active research area of image processing and computer 
vision. Through the visual surveillance, human activities can be 
monitored in sensitive and public areas such as bus stations, railway 
stations, airports, banks, shopping malls, school and col- leges, parking 
lots, roads, etc. to prevent terrorism, theft, accidentsand illegal parking,
vandalism, fighting, chain snatching, crime and other suspicious
activities.
